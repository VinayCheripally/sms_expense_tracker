# Background SMS Listening Solutions

## Current Problem

The current implementation using `react-native-android-sms-listener` has limitations:

1. **Android 6+ Restrictions**: Background broadcast receivers are heavily restricted
2. **Expo Managed Workflow**: Cannot add native Android code (Java/Kotlin)
3. **Battery Optimization**: Android kills background processes aggressively
4. **Security Restrictions**: Apps need special permissions and services

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Expo Development Build (Recommended)

Create a development build that includes the necessary native modules:

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Configure for development build
eas build:configure

# Create development build with custom native code
eas build --platform android --profile development
```

**Pros:**
- Can include custom native modules
- Still uses Expo tooling
- Supports background processing

**Cons:**
- Requires ejecting from pure managed workflow
- More complex setup

### Option 2: Expo Bare Workflow (Full Control)

Eject to bare workflow to add native Android code:

```bash
npx expo eject
```

Then implement native BroadcastReceiver in Android.

**Pros:**
- Full control over native code
- Can implement proper background SMS listening
- Best performance

**Cons:**
- Loses Expo managed workflow benefits
- Requires Android development knowledge

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Current + Foreground)

Keep current implementation but enhance it:

1. **Foreground Service**: Use when app is active
2. **User Education**: Teach users to keep app in recent apps
3. **Notification Reminders**: Remind users to check for missed transactions

## Recommended Implementation

Since we're in Expo managed workflow, here's the enhanced approach:

### 1. Enhanced Foreground Detection
